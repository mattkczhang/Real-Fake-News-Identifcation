# Real-Fake-News-Identifcation

The Real / Fake News Identification project is a in-class group project at Macalester College Statistical Machine Learning course in 2019 fall. 

## Description

The project intends to classify the news based on their title and text using logistic, KNN, decision tree, and random forest models. The features for modeling are designed and defined our group baased on titles and texts. We finally figure out that the logistic model can generate the highest cross-validated / out-of-bag accuracy, around 82%. The result is robust with different input features and model regularization. 

The final logistic model can be applied to the real-world by recognizing fake news based on titles and contents. Given that fake news as a term was added to Oxford Dictionary and widely used among different situations, it is valuable to have such classfication tool for better information processing.
